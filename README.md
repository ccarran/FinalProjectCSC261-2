# Videogame Database Client App

This project consists in a client app and a server app, which hosts a videogame database that allows users to keep track of games they have played. The application also has popularity and score systems, has a GUI that allows users to easily look for games and add them to their lists, and contains different windows where users can check their list, or access the information of each videogame. This project is inspired by webpages like IMDB and MyAnimeList.
